# TensorFlow.js Object Detection App

Welcome to the TensorFlow.js Object Detection App! This web application allows you to detect objects in images using the COCO-SSD object detection model powered by TensorFlow.js. The app provides an interactive interface to upload images and visualize the detected objects with bounding boxes.

## Features

- Upload an image to detect objects.
- Display detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
- Supports real-time object detection using the COCO-SSD model.
- User-friendly interface with stylish components.

## How It Works

1. When you open the app, you'll see an option to select an image using the "Select Image" button.
2. Click on the button and choose an image from your device.
3. The selected image will be displayed in the center of the screen.
4. The app will process the image using the COCO-SSD object detection model.
5. Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with their corresponding class names and detection scores.

## Technologies Used

- React: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TensorFlow.js: The app leverages TensorFlow.js to load and utilize the COCO-SSD pre-trained object detection model.
- Styled Components: Styling is managed with Styled Components, offering modular and maintainable CSS styling.
